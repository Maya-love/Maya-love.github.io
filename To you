  <h1>Letters to Vikranth</h1>

    <div class="date">✉️ July 27, 2025</div>
    <p>Dearest Vikranth,</p>

    <p>Today marks one year since we broke up. It’s strange how even our goodbye has an anniversary — something we never got to celebrate for our love. And yet, here I am, still full of you.</p>

    <p>I miss you in ways words can't always explain. I miss the boy who stared at me in my pajamas like I was magic. I miss your smile — those dimples that could break my heart all over again — and your brown eyes that made me feel like I belonged.</p>

    <p>You were beautiful. And you were mine. I still love you like nothing else. Not out of weakness, not out of pride — but because some loves don’t vanish with time. They settle deep and ache quietly.</p>

    <p>Maybe one day, you'll read this. Maybe you never will. But I had to write it — for me. For us.</p>

    <p class="signature">Always your girl,<br><strong>Maya</strong></p>
